**No further updates are planned.**

📢 **Notes :**

This project is carried out in order to practise and master the web fundamentals. If there is a need to reuse it to develop another advanced project, you should make some improvement in the source code.

The english tests used in this project are just some examples of assessments. If you are interested to develop a real use case such as Toefl and Toeic, the assessments should be prepared after doing more researches in the english language references.
